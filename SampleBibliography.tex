% This bibliography is organized using the natbib package. You can use different bibliography styles to suit your needs. You will enter your bibliography entries into the mybib.bib file. This way, you can use the "cite" button on your Google Scholar searches and cut-and-paste the bibtex citation information directly into the bib file. This SampleBibliography.tex file is just the place where the bibliography manifests itself. It pulls the information that you've cited in the text from you mybib.bib file and formats it for inclusion in the printed bibliography.

% This revision of the template includes a file called apsr_fs.bst. This is called in the \bibliographystyle{} command above. If you wish to use a different .bst file, you can include that file in your main project folder and then adjust the \bibliographystyle{} call above as needed. You may also need to adjust the \bibpunct{} call in the preamble of the UNLTthesisTemplate.tex file so that your inline citations match your chosen citation style. Often, your .bst file will have instructions for doing this in a commented section at the beginning of the file.

% If you find yourself having difficulty getting the bibliography to render properly after you've made changes to it, you may need to go into your main project file and delete the auxilliary files that your LaTeX GUI creates. These will include files ending in ..aux, .bbl, .blg, .lof, .log, .pdf, .gz, and .toc. Often, deleting these files and then re-rendering your file will solve the problem.
