% Insert your bibtex entries here. Reference them in the text of your chapters. You'll make a call to this file in your SampleBibliography.tex file. This is the list of references that the SampleBibliography.tex file will draw from in order to populate your bibliography. Only those references you cite in the text of your document will appear in the bibliography. If you put citations in this file that you don't reference elsewhere, they will not show up in the text of your document.
