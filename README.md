# UNLVthesisTemplate
This is a template for a thesis or dissertation that meets the formatting requirements of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Graduate College.  This package was originally developed by Professor Arthur Baragar. It was updated in 2016 by Professor Rebecca Gill. The content in the sample chapters was contributed by both Baragar and Dr. Gill. Additional content explaining the current (as of June 2016) UNLV Graduate College formatting  requirements is taken directly from the September 17, 2015 "Organization of the Thesis and Dissertation Compiled Manuals."
