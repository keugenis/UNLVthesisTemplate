% The title in the square brackets is a workaround to get the colon and space to appear properly in the table of contents. Just include a colon, a space, and then the title of your chapter in the square brackets. The title should appear without the colon and space in the curly brackets.

This section of the template will give you some information about the basic formatting requirements for your thesis or dissertation. To the extent possible, these requirements have been built into this template. The text below comes directly from the ``UNLV Graduate College: General Guidelines for Theses \& Dissertations'' September 1, 2015, update (\url{https://www.unlv.edu/sites/default/files/page_files/27/GradCollege-ThesisDissertation-Guidelines.pdf}) and the ``UNLV Graduate College's Organization of the Thesis and Dissertation Compiled Manuals'' updated September 17, 2015 (\url{https://www.unlv.edu/sites/default/files/page_files/27/GradCollege-ThesisDissertation-Manual.pdf}). It is your responsibility to check with the Graduate College to confirm that there have been no subsequent updates to the formatting requirements. If you see that there are changes that impact this template, please contact Dr.\ Gill at \url{rebecca.gill@unlv.edu}. 

\section{Fonts}

The font must be a standard style that is clear and readable, typically in 11, or 12 point size. Do not use cursive, script or italicized fonts except where allowed or required by your chosen style guide (Chicago, APA, ASA, MLA, etc.). Font size must be consistent throughout the text. Chapter titles and section titles can be larger font size than the standard text, if in accordance with the student's approved style guide and advisory committee. This style decision must be applied consistently throughout the text. The font size of tables and figures can be smaller than the standard text if in accordance with the student's style guide and advisory committee (8 pt.\ minimum). This style decision must be applied consistently throughout the text.

\section{Spacing and Margins}

 The document must be double spaced; the only exceptions are captions, foot‐ notes, long  quotations, bibliographic references, table titles and descriptions, figure titles and descriptions,  inserted materials such as tables, images, diagrams, graphs, etc., and the author's curriculum  vit\ae. Extended direct quotations must be handled according to the rules of your chosen style guide and the direction of your advisory committee. 
 
 Paragraphs should be indented the same number of spaces throughout the document, and
 spacing between paragraphs should be consistent. Spacing around titles, headings and subheadings should be consistent and match the student's chosen style guide. You can find an instruction manual on how to create this page on the Thesis and Dissertation website. 

 All pages should have a 1” margin on all sides (top, bottom, right, and left). Top and bottom margins must be blank with the exception of the page number at the bottom center of the page (please see item 2 – Page Numbering). Do not include other headers or footers.
