\chapter*{Appendix: Title of Appendix}% Chapter titles can be capitalized or lower case, but they must be consistent throughout. 
\addcontentsline{toc}{schapter}{Appendix}

This section is optional. If you have only one appendix, it is titled as above. If you have more than one, you should use Appendix A, B, C, etc. You should label any tables or figures in this section just as you did for your chapters, because they should also appear in your list of tables and/or figures. 

Oversized and digital items can be attached to the document through an appendix. The location of each of these items should be referenced in the appendix. Most of the time, this means you'd include text under the title of the appendix that says what it is and where it can be found. For example, it might say ``Dataset can be found at www.unlv.edu/mydata.''
